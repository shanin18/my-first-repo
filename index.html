    <ul>
        <li>
            What is Git? What are the advantages of Git?
            <p>
                Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
                 <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fast</li>
                    <li>Does not lose data(has proper fsck, checksums, every developer has full copy of the repository, well written code).</li>
                    <li>Distribute(meaning, handles branching and merging very well).</li>
                    <li>Ability to create commits that do not match the collection of all modified files("index" or "staging area").</li>
                    <li>gives you lots of freedom.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            What do you understand by the term "Version Control System"?
            <p>Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code. </p>
        </li>
